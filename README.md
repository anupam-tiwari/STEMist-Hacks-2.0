## Lo - Fi nance Band

## Inspiration

As an international student studying in the US, I embarked on a thrilling journey filled with new experiences and opportunities. However, one thing I had to leave behind was my cherished piano back in my home country. The joy of playing the piano has always been an integral part of my life, but in the US, the cost of purchasing one proved to be a daunting challenge, far beyond my budget. Though I yearn to own a physical piano one day, virtual instruments have become my steadfast companions on this musical journey. They have been more than just a cost-effective alternative; they have become a source of inspiration and empowerment. Not only me, but also my fellow colleagues are going through the same challenge, so we used this as an inspiration and developed this idea.

## What it does

Lo-Fi nance Band is a web app that allows users to play virtual music instruments, compose tracks by combining beats and lyrics, and even indulge in creative expression through a virtual painter. The platform aims to provide affordable accessibility to musical instruments and promote exploration without worrying about spatial constraints.

## How we built it

We built Lo-Fi nance Band as a web-based solution using modern web development technologies. The virtual instruments and creative tools were implemented using OpenCV, Python, Pygames, Streamlit, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Challenges we ran into

Throughout the development process, we faced challenges in technical side as well as managing the time-zones, it was really difficult to play with camera system as all of them have different resolutions so we had  to ensure a smooth user experience. Integrating the lyrics generator and virtual painter into the platform also presented some technical hurdles.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud to have created a feature-rich platform that addresses the problem of expensive musical instruments and limited space. The ability to offer a diverse range of virtual instruments and a user-friendly interface has been a significant achievement for our team.

## What we learned

Developing Lo-Fi nance Band taught us valuable lessons in web application development, especially in creating interactive and engaging user interfaces. Additionally, we gained insights into the challenges faced by musicians in pursuing their passion and how technology can bridge those gaps.

## What's next for Lo-Fi nance Band

In the future, we plan to enhance the platform by adding features such as track editing and publishing on different platforms like Spotify, SoundCloud, and YouTube. Moreover, we aspire to explore monetization options to help musicians earn from their creations through ads and sponsorships, making Lo-Fi nance Band a comprehensive and empowering musical ecosystem.
